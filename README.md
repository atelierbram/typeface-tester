TYPEFACE TESTER
===============

System Font Viewer for iOS

[This is meant to be used on an iOS-device](https://atelierbram.github.com/typeface-tester/ "typeface-tester,  System Font Viewer - for iOS ") , like an iPad, iPod or iPhone, by e-book editors, web-designers, and everyone else who enjoys typefaces.
The default typeface of the body-text is set on ‘Verdana’ with a fall-back of ‘cursive’, which means that if the font from the select menu is not on you’re O.S., the font is rendered as ‘Cursive’, some kind of handwriting typeface. In iOS this will be the ‘Snellroundhand’ typeface, on you’re PC it will most likely will be different, depending on you’re operation system.
